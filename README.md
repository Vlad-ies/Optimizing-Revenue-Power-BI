# Maximizing Earnings from E-Commerce Sports Retail
Analyzing product data for an online sports retail company to optimize revenue. This project uses the same data from the (Optimizing-Revenue-SQL)[https://github.com/Vlad-ies/Optimizing-Revenue-SQL] project but uses its own insights and conclusions not related to that project. Caution: Data are only theoretical sense because only 2 brands are considered, not proportional huge amount of discounts, in one of the brand’s sale price > listing price, etc. <br />
## Overview
Our aim is to evaluate sales strategies by analyzing metrics and indicators to improve team performance and strategy effectiveness. Insights from plots revealed unexpected price differences between listing and sale prices, leading to discount impact analysis. Negative Discount Sales and positive Impact on Revenue indicate strategic discounts may drive increased sales volume or attract new customers. Notably, 50% and 40% discounts generate substantial revenue. Product Reviews and Ratings show Nike's favorability over Adidas, with 5.0 ratings indicating the most reviewed and purchased products despite the fact that Nike is sold without a discount at all. Gender analysis highlights male products as top revenue generators, with significant revenue differences attributed to discounts. <br />
### Report
First and foremost, we changed the name of columns to understand which tables are dimensional and which is a fact table and managed relationships between tables. Then we did basic conversions of columns to have an appropriate data type, format and used the first row as headers. In a time-series variable ‘last_visited’, there were only 3 years, and it was decided to keep only 2 years such as 2018,2019, and not 2020 to avoid outliers that COVID brought to the world. Hence, we applied a filter on all pages in our report. <br /> 
## Sales Performance Analysis
Sales performance analysis is the process of evaluating and assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of a company's sales activities and strategies. It involves analyzing various sales-related metrics, data, and performance indicators to gain insights into how well the sales team is performing, how effective the sales strategies are, and where improvements can be made to enhance overall sales results. <br /> 
There were created 3-line plots: Monthly Total Listing Price, Monthly Total Sale Price, and Monthly Total Revenue against the time-series variable ‘last_visited’, and the first insight came up unexpectedly in the difference between sale and listing prices, the smallest difference was at least 1200 dollars between listing price and sale price for brand Adidas. We would have liked to dive deeper and calculate the discounted sales amount and the impact of discounts on revenue (This measure will show the difference between the total revenue without discounts and the discounted revenue):

As a result, Discount Sales have a negative value, and the Impact of Discounts on Revenue – is positive. This scenario could occur if the discounts are strategically applied to incentivize higher sales volume or if they attract new customers who make additional purchases. While the sales prices may be reduced due to discounts, the overall increased sales volume or customer acquisition might lead to a positive impact on the company's revenue. <br />
From the graph – ‘Monthly Sales Revenue with Discount’ it is noticeable that except for 0 % discount which means without discount the most revenue discounts are 50 and 40 %. <br />
‘Revenue Impact Analysis by Product with Discounts’ reveals the most generated revenue products.  <br />
## Product Reviews and Ratings
Product Reviews and Ratings refer to the feedback and evaluations provided by customers who have purchased and used its products. <br />
The first thing that catches the eye of this canvas is the tremendous disproportion between the two brands. Adidas owns 87.5% vs Nike approximately 13% of this niche.  <br />
A rating of 5.0 is the best score for the rate and simultaneously the most counted products belong to this group. 81 pairs of Nike shoes got a score of 5.0 in comparison to 67 of Adidas and this trend follows through the whole rating meaning that the Nike brand is more favorite than Adidas.  <br />
As an improvement insight, a company might have in stock more Nike shoes which may lead to more sales and hence to more revenue. <br />
## Customer Gender
In the product name, there is a pattern about the gender. In many cases, there are words such as Men’s, men’s, MEN’S, Women’s… and so on. Under this condition, it was decided to create a conditional new column in Dim_info_v2 table. Before creating a new column, it should be replaced values like men’s should be Men’s, WOMEN’S – Women’s etc. The following step is to create a conditional column using IF statement and as an outcome, we got Male, Female, and Unisex categories. <br />
The saleable products are for the male category (1376 products) and therefore the most revenue (over 5.5 million dollars) the corporation gets from this category. Then a female category with 612 products sold and the last category is unisex.  <br />
From a box plot, we confirmed that the male product generates the most revenue, and our previous assumptions on the former canvas about if on average the rating is higher for the shoes, it will be sold more. If the analysis goes further, it might be considered outliers, mean, median, IQR. <br />
From the last steps, we were trying to understand how discounts influence revenue for different genders. For this purpose, firstly was plotted the heatmap shows that male shoes are likely to be bought on sale in contrast to different groups. This big difference is also revealed in the table when prices and revenue differ by about 2 times between males and females, but the discounted sales differ by more than 5 times between these 2 groups. <br />
